# stm32async
Asynchronous I/O C++ library

This is not the most efficient, least space-requiring or most convenient  
object-oriented library for using in embedded system developing. However  
it is developing to be useful and enjoyable while also being among the most  
efficient, space-utilizing, portable and configurable library to make SW  
developing easier and faster with support of high-level abstraction.
